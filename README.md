# CanidaeOS

CanidaeOS is an OS designed to be crash-resistant, stable, and secure. It accomplishes this through a microkernel architecture.
It supports 64-bit processors only.

## Projects

* African Wild Dog (awd): A shim bootloader for x86_64, to go from a multibooted protected mode to a 64-bit environment.
* Lobo: A 64-bit microkernel.
